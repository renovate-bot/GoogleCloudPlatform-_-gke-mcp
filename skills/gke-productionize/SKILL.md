# GKE Productionize Skill

This skill acts as a high-level orchestrator for preparing a GKE cluster and its workloads for production readiness. It covers discovery, assessment, and references specialized skills for detailed implementation.

## Scope

This skill is adaptable to:

- A single application (already on Kubernetes or not).
- A set of applications.
- A target cluster.

## Workflow

### 1. Discovery Phase

Before making recommendations, discover the current state of the environment.

#### Cluster Discovery

Run these commands to understand the cluster setup:

- Check cluster details: `gcloud container clusters describe <cluster-name> --location <location> --project <project>`
- Check for Autopilot vs Standard: Look for `autopilot: true` in the describe output.
- Check release channel: Look for `releaseChannel`.

#### Workload Discovery

If a specific application is targeted, discover its configuration:

- Get deployment/statefulset details: `kubectl get deployment <app-name> -n <namespace> -o yaml`
- Check for resource requests and limits.
- Check for liveness, readiness, and startup probes.
- Check for HPA: `kubectl get hpa -n <namespace>`
- Check for PDB: `kubectl get pdb -n <namespace>`
- Check for NetworkPolicies: `kubectl get networkpolicy -n <namespace>`

### 2. Production Readiness Assessment

Go through these areas and assess readiness. Delegate detailed implementation to domain-specific skills.

#### A. App Onboarding (Pre-Kubernetes)

If the application is not yet running on GKE, delegate to the [gke-app-onboarding](../gke-app-onboarding/SKILL.md) skill for containerization and initial deployment.

#### B. Scalability & Resource Management

Ensure workloads have appropriate resources and autoscaling.

- **Action**: Delegate to [gke-workload-scaling](../gke-workload-scaling/SKILL.md) for configuring HPA, VPA, and resource limits.

#### C. Observability

Ensure adequate logging and monitoring are in place.

- **Action**: Delegate to [gke-observability](../gke-observability/SKILL.md) for setting up Cloud Logging, Monitoring, and Managed Prometheus.

#### D. Reliability

Ensure high availability and graceful degradation.

- **Action**: Delegate to [gke-reliability](../gke-reliability/SKILL.md) for configuring regional clusters, PDBs, and health probes.

#### E. Security

Harden the cluster and workloads.

- **Action**: Delegate to [gke-workload-security](../gke-workload-security/SKILL.md) for Workload Identity, Network Policies, and Shielded Nodes.

#### F. Backup & Disaster Recovery

Ensure stateful data is protected.

- **Action**: Delegate to [gke-backup-dr](../gke-backup-dr/SKILL.md) for configuring Backup for GKE and restore procedures.

#### G. Edge Security & Ingress

Secure external access.

- **Action**: Delegate to [gke-networking-edge](../gke-networking-edge/SKILL.md) for Gateway API, Ingress, and Cloud Armor.

#### H. Deployment & GitOps

Adopt modern deployment practices.

- **Action**: Delegate to [gke-gitops-delivery](../gke-gitops-delivery/SKILL.md) for Config Sync or ArgoCD.

#### I. Cost Optimization

Ensure efficient use of resources.

- **Action**: Delegate to [gke-cost-optimization](../gke-cost-optimization/SKILL.md) for strategies on rightsizing, quotas, and Spot VMs.

### 3. Production Readiness Scoring

After the assessment, provide a summary report with a RAG (Red, Amber, Green) status for each area and an overall readiness score. This helps prioritize remediation efforts.

## Adaptability Guidelines

- **Single App**: Focus on Health Probes, HPA, Resource Limits, PDB, and Workload Identity for that specific app.
- **Cluster Wide**: Focus on Cluster Autoscaler, Multi-zonal setup, Release Channels, Maintenance Windows, and default Network Policies.
- **Interactive Approach**: Always ask the user for confirmation or missing info before proceeding with recommendations.
